This Repository contains the different machine learning projects with different models from logistic regression model to the complicated convolutional neuronal networks.In this every Project will have Tensorboard Graph implemented and you can visualize it by typing in command prompt and going in the directory in which our project is :    tensorboard --logdir=logs    .  This logs is the path that you define in the "LogisticRegression.py" for example: in line 13 and 14 we define the log path to be "./logs/train" and "./logs/test" ,but we giving the path in the command prompt we only say tensorboard --logdir=logs and not specific to the train or the test set.
