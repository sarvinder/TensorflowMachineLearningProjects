This is the quick and dirty implementation on CIFAR-10 in tensorflow.
****************************ADVISE****************************
make sure that you change the run implementation to get small batches
because right now it is taking 10,000 batch at a time which is very 
large so be sure to change it .(around 250 will be nice).
************The newer implementation will be out soon*****************
